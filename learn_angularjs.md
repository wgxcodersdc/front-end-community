AngularJS is one of the many popular open source Javascript frameworks.  Its goal is to simplify the development and testing of applications that follow the [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) and [Model-View-View-Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) architecture.  It is a "Single Page Application" (SPA) meta framework where it is heavily focus on eliminating the work of having to go back and forth between the server and the client but rather having it be heavily driven by Javascript.

Tools and Prerequisites
-----------------------

AngularJS requires the knowledge of some basic programming structure and full understanding of Javascript syntax since it is a library designed in Java Script.  It is  difficult if you don't hold the understanding of those two components.  Some resources that can be used to learn Javascript are:

* [Egghead: JavaScript Lessons](https://egghead.io/technologies/js?order=ASC)

Books and Articles
* [Code School JS Books and Materials Gallery](http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/)
* Heads First JavaScript
* Eloquent Javascript

The tools needed to developing an AngularJS application is simply a browser and text editor.  Some popular text editors that developers use are **Sublime Text, Brackets** and **NotePad ++**.

Core Features in AngularJS
--------------------------
* Directives </li>
* Controllers </li>
* Scopes </li>
* Services</li>
* Dependency Injections

### Directives
Directives are a way to extend HTML, adding new elements and adding new attributes to existing elements.  The ways that directives can be used are by adding behavior to HTML, defining a *link* function that keeps bidirectional binding between variables belonging to scopes and DOM elements or defining a compile function that can modify or generate DOM elements attributes.

### Controllers
Controllers are components that add functionality across DOM elements within the application.  The idea behind controllers is to keep an organization of application component functionality so that it will remain maintainable and accessible.

### Scopes
Scope is a way how AngularJS allows two separate components to communicate with each other between controllers and views. In laymen terms it serves as the "glue" between the controller and the view.

### Dependency Injections
Dependency Injections are basically a special word for claiming a component is dependent on another component or service within the application.  It is equivalent to the syntax and functionality of "required" in Node.JS or Ruby or for Java "required."

What are the benefits of Angular JS
-----------------------------------

* AngularJS applications can be styled using CSS and HTML independent of their own business logic and function.  Therefore you can a huge change in the layout of the application without having to make changes to the Javascript

* AngularJS applications are written in pure HTML, so designers will be able to work and style them with ease.

* AngularJS applications are a lot easier to run unit testing.

* AngularJS applications work very well and smoothly with third-party libraries

* Angular JS applications have a declarative nature thus making it easier to write and understand.

* AngularJS has a large community that is thriving and always contributing to the evolvement of the framework.
