# CodeShare

## Role of CodeShare

At Women Who Code DC, we use CodeShares to sign in attendees and share relevant links and events at each session. This allows us to quickly share links and other resources with attendees who have not joined Slack yet.

## How to Create a Codeshare

1. Visit http://codeshare.io/
2. Login in with the WWCDC account (ask leads in Slack for info)
3. Give the CodeShare a name with the date, e.g. "Front End Lab - Monday, March 7th, 2016"
4. Copy and paste the CodeShare Text into the blank CodeShare
5. Write the CodeShare URL on the whiteboard to share awith attendees
6. Encourage attendees to sign up

## Share Codeshare with Attendees

Write the CodeShare URL on a whiteboard in large, easy to read handwriting at the meeting. Note: CodeShare URLs are case-sensitive and may contain special characters.

If a CodeShare URL contains a pipe (|) special character, you are likely better off creating a new URL.

For the First Timer's night, create a section for attendees to sign up for the HTML & CSS guide, and another section for the JavaScript guide. Use the number of sign ups for each guide to determine which session should go into which room.
