# Front End Lab Checklist/Guidance
For special events such as tech talks, panels, etc. outside of usual lab nights (or first timers nights)

## To-Do's
* Secure a date, time, and venue (regular Monday nights or Thursday nights are best for language events)
 * Coordinate with Su for hosts/refreshments information
* Post an event on Meetup page
 * Check maximum capacity of venue and enforce limit on Meetup event
 * Respond to comments promptly
* Confirm who will be participating in the event (Panel? Guest speaker? Forum? Roundtable?)

## Contacts for event planning
* Lauren: planning overall WWC events (including event collabs with other meetups); also adding event/viewing access to WWC general Meetup calendar to avoid event clashes
* Su: finding hosts for the event
* Pam: coordinating general "Tech Talk Thursday" events
 * Good topics for these types of events include things that mix front end tech with other types of tech (ie React Native, Clojurescript, etc.)

## Responsibilities during event
* Photos
* Video (if requested by host or other sponsor; unable to do streaming)
* Twitter: for live tweeting the event
