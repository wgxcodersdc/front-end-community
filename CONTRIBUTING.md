# Contributing to the front-end-community repository
Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC is looking forward to any additions to this repository! Here are the steps on how to get started with contributions:

1. First, check with any of the @womenwhocodedc/front-end-leads regarding permissions to write to the repository. Once you have write permissions, clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:womenwhocodedc/front-end-community.git`

2. From the cloned repository on your local machine, create a feature branch using `git checkout -b` with your *last name* and the name of your feature in this format: `lastName_myFeature`

3. Add your changes to your repo using the regular Git commands (`git add/rm` and `git commit`), then push to *your feature branch* `git push origin lastName_myFeature`.

4. Your feature branch will be visible on the main repository page, like so:
![alt text](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/front-end-community/raw/master/assets/wwcpr.png "pull request view")

5. Create a pull request (PR) by clicking on "Compare & pull request", and be sure to reference @womenwhocodedc/front-end-leads, @alulsh, and @kdmcclin in your PR comment. Also be sure to reference the issue number in your PR if you are trying to fix an issue.

6. If everything looks good, the reviewer will merge your PR into the master branch and delete your feature branch. And then your changes will be in the main repository! However...

7. If you need to make changes before your PR has been merged (whether you want to or you've been requested by the reviewer to make more changes), you can continue pushing the changes to your feature branch; the pull request will be updated with your subsequent commits.

And that's all there is to it!
