<h1>CSS Study Guide</h1>

So, if you’re reading this, I’m assuming you’ve got a handle on HTML and are looking to learn how to make it look pretty, or at the very least not completely boring. You may also be a more advanced coder looking to learn how to create basic effects, like hovering boxes, and fooling around with opacity or making dropdown menu’s (yes, you can do this in CSS). 

### Learning Resources Legend

Thankfully, there are a ton of resources at your disposal.  Here are some that we at Women and Gender eXpansive Coders D.C. recommend.
If you haven’t been introduced to the resource legends that we are using to label and direct you to the resource that is best for you based on learning style and complexity, here is a recap:

According to[http://www.learning-styles-online.com/][1], [http://www.learning-styles-online.com/][2], [http://www.educationplanner.org/][3], and Wikipedia (yes I used Wikipedia, there were like 30 different sources so I think it’s safe), there are three basic learning styles. They are:

 1. Visual : :video_camera:– This means you learn better when there are visuals, including pictures, diagrams, and occasionally books. You literally need to see it to believe it (or understand it). Flash cards, videos and color coded materials are your friend.
 2. Auditory: :headphones: – you learn best by hearing and listening to things. For you, this means lectures/classes, videos, and audiobooks (and sometimes games if you can find any, thought this really works for everyone). Also, occasionally books and flash cards if you’re willing to read out loud (It may seem a little elementary but it works).
 3. Tactile/kinesthetic: computer:– You like to learn by doing stuff, explanations be damned. Sitting there and listening to or reading long winded explanations of things isn’t really your thing. You’d much rather learn through trial and error and have someone demonstrate how to do something. Lucky for you, a lot of the most popular online resources are most suited to your style of learning. Anything that gives a lot of examples and allows you to try things out is best for you. 


This is one way we are organizing the resources listed. If you’d like to figure out which learning style is best for you, you could always do a quick google search or try taking the quiz at http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml.  


We are also organizing by complexity:

 1. Beginners :new_moon:– These are materials for people who range from only knowing a little to knowing absolutely nothing. These materials include basic descriptions, history and the tools you need to get started. 
 2. Intermediate :first_quarter_moon:– Pretty sure most people know what intermediate means, but just in case you want to know what we mean by it, here goes. People who know the basics. People that can implement the programming or scripting language they are trying to learn to some capacity. If you’re learning CSS, this would be someone who is somewhat comfortable creating external styling sheets and changing background colors or styling footers.
 3. Advanced :full_moon_with_face:– Advanced? What are you folks doing here? Just kidding, an advanced person would be someone who is fluent in a language, possibly using it professionally and is looking for more in depth or outright new material. To be honest, the amount of material we have for advanced learners is limited since WWCDC is a little more aimed at introducing women to programming rather than advancing those who are already in it. However, we are open to all and will definitely try to keep people updated on any new information that is related to front-end programming.
 

So, back to CSS resources. Most CSS classes are taught together with HTML so you will see a lot of resource overlap between this section and the HTML section; however we will try to include as many CSS specific resources as possible:

[Udemy][4]- :video_camera::headphones::new_moon::first_quarter_moon: is a website that has video based classes for everything under the sun including CSS and several other markup and programming languages. Most of the classes are paid, however there are a few CSS classes that are free and if you sign up for their email alerts you can be notified for any sale they have on classes. It’s definitely worth it to sign up since many of their most popular course drop to as low as $10 per course, several times a year even though they generally  go from anywhere between $100 and $500 per course. As stated, all the lectures are video based and they both explain and demonstrate everything for you. Most CSS courses teach you how to build a web page from scratch using a text editor instead of just learning in a console. Some of the courses even include things like free web hosting. Some sample classes that pop up in a search include: CSS development with CSS 3, Projects in CSS, CSS- comprehensive CSS for beginners, 1hr CSS (this one is free) etc. Udemy also has practice project classes and other kinds of slightly more advanced classes.


[Code School][5] :video_camera::headphones::new_moon::first_quarter_moon::full_moon_with_face:- This is a fun little video based scripting and programming tutorial website. It is made up of videos with cute little songs filled with lots of information about one of the 3 different languages they teach and has several electives. You can choose between 6 paths including Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, IOS (building apps), Git (a version control system, more on that later) and electives (which include everything else). You have the opportunity to earn badges and rewards as you work your way through the programs. A few of their course are free, but for full access to everything, it will cost you about $30 a month. In all honesty, you could probably work your way through the entire site if you were diligent enough so $30 a month probably isn’t too bad. Like with Udemy, the above applies. Within the HTML/CSS track, there are intermediate course that include course based on mobile first and responsive design. By the time you finish with this, you should be more than a little bit comfortable with CSS. The HTML/CSS track for Code School can literally take you from complete beginner to well-versed expert if you got through the whole thing. By the time you get towards the end of the course, it starts tackling framework like Bootstrap, and preprocessors like SASS with Compass add-ons which is definitely worth taking a look at.


[The Magic of CSS][6] :first_quarter_moon:- this is a beautiful website that includes tutorials that read like a book (with explanations and all that) but has great examples of CSS included. It’s a great reference and learning guide, worth taking a look at. 

[Codeacademy][7]-:new_moon::computer: is one of the most popular online interactive learning platform tools. HTML/CSS is one of 8 different languages that you can learn using codeacademy. Everything is done in the console, so you don’t have to worry about things like text editors and folders or FTP. All you have to do is access the website, log in and get started. By the way, it’s completely free.

[Dash: General Assembly][8]- :new_moon::computer: Dash is another online interactive learning platform tool created by the manager and co-founder of a popular programming school called General Assembly (they even have a campus in D.C. if you’re interested). It is actually even more intuitive than codeacademy because many of their lessons include diagrams, and some background history but it covers a little less than codeacademy. It teaches HTML/CSS in tandem with a touch of Javascript, so you will also have a basic introduction to real programming. If you’re brand new to this and having a little trouble with other online programming tools, definitely try Dash. It is also free and all you have to do is access the website, log on and get started. 

[CSS Diner: Select the Plates][9]:computer: :first_quarter_moon:- This is a small game I found online that helps you learn how to handle selectors. It’s completely console based just like the other sites found in this section.

[CSS Selectors][10] :first_quarter_moon:- This is a handy online reference tool that shows you how to apply different kinds of selectors (child, descendent that kind of thing) into your CSS and HTML files. It doesn’t really teach you if you know nothing at all, but it does help if you have an idea of what these are and how to use them but forgot the syntax for using them in your stylesheet or web page.

[Enjoy CSS.com][11] :computer: :first_quarter_moon: - This is a handy tool you can use to experiment with different design elements, all you do is choose between several different styling options, click next, and it will show you the actual code you need to paste into your style sheet to recreate the effect. You definitely need to know a little bit to understand what’s going on but if you use it enough, you could probably pick up on how to create stuff on your own.
